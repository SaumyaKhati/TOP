    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking water.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until 
            soft and translucent while penne is cooking, about 5 minutes. 
            Add garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds. 
            Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. 
            Add cream and Parmesan cheese and season with salt, pepper, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir some pasta cooking water into the sauce and add cooked penne. 
            Remove from heat and stir in cherry tomatoes, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and basil. 
            Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
